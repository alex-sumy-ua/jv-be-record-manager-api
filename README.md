Northcoders Record Shop API Mini Project
 
Tasks

Designing and building the backend for the record shop inventory system which will allow the Northcoders Record Shop to:
- Store information about the records they have in stock.
- Query this data in various ways.
- Update it accordingly.

User Stories

For the Northcoders Record Shop inventory system, I want the backend API endpoints to be able to return and interact with the data in the following way:
- list all albums in stock
- get album by id
- list all albums by a given artist
- list all albums by a given release year
- list all albums by a given genre
- get album information by album name
- add new albums into the database
- update album details
- delete albums from the database

Used technologies
- H2 in-memory DB
- PostgreSQL
- Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API)
- Spring Web
- Spring Actuator
